Given three hypothetical investment options (based off real securities, such as shares, bonds, and savings), actuarial financial analysis is applied for a comprehensive evaluation of each option. Excel VBA is used to generate simulations
and possible trajectories, with an easy to follow layout so factors that can affect each investment can easily be identified and compared. Graphs are also generated through Excel to create visual interpretations of possible trajectories of investments.
The entire worksheet is highly parameterized, with clear 'parameter boxes' which can easily be updated by the user to reflect changing or entirely different scenarios.

Findings are presented within the Excel document, with a clear structure including hyperlinks and a table of contents for easy navigation. 

This was the main assignment for ACTL2111 - Financial Mathematics for Actuaries, which I received full marks for.
